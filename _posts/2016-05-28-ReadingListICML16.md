To make a habit of reading more papers, I have decided to write comments, may be some quick or sometime detail, on  the papers which I find interesting and related to my research area. Hopefully, this will come handy in solving my own research problems.

**Starting with ICML 2016 Papers:**

* Revisiting Semi-Supervised Learning with Graph Embeddings ICML 2016
* Why Regularized Auto-Encoders learn  Sparse Representation? ICML 2016
* On the Consistency of Feature Selection With Lasso for Non-linear Targets. ICML 2016
* Additive Approximations in High Dimensional Nonparametric Regression via the SALSA. ICML 2016
* The Variational Nystrom method for large-scale spectral problems. ICML 2016
* A Kernelized Stein Discrepancy for Goodness-of-fit Tests and Model Evaluation. ICML 2016 (Possibly a new way to measure difference in probability distribution other than most common -- KL divergence )
* Low-Rank Matrix Approximation with Stability. ICML 2016
* Unsupervised Deep Embedding for Clustering Analysis. ICML 2016
* Online Low-Rank Subspace Clustering by Explicit Basis Modeling. ICML 2016
* Community Recovery in Graphs with Locality. ICML 2016
* Analysis of Deep Neural Networks with Extended Data Jacobian Matrix. ICML 2016
* Stochastic Variance Reduced Optimization for Nonconvex Sparse Learning. ICML 2016
* Compressive Spectral Clustering ICML. 2016
* Variance-Reduced and Projection-Free Stochastic Optimization. ICML 2016
* Learning Convolutional Neural Networks for Graphs. ICML 2016
